Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels of access to data, users, and settings. Regular user accounts should never be utilized for administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, to keep Administrative accounts separated from on-prem accounts. Administrative accounts should not have applications assigned so that they have no access to potentially vulnerable services (EX. email, Teams, SharePoint, etc.) and only access to perform tasks as needed for administrative purposes.

#### Remediation action:

To created licensed, separate Administrative accounts for Administrative users:
1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Click to expand **Users** select **Active users**
3. Click **Add a user**.
4. Fill out the appropriate fields for Name, user, etc.

Rationale: The security risk of not having visibility into cyber attacks is reduced by collecting logs in the agency’s centralized security detection infrastructure. This makes security events available for auditing, query, and incident response.

Note: The following logs (configured in Entra diagnostic settings), are required: `AuditLogs`, `SignInLogs`, `RiskyUsers`, `UserRiskEvents`, `NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `ServicePrincipalSignInLogs`, `ADFSSignInLogs`, `RiskyServicePrincipals`, `ServicePrincipalRiskEvents`, `EnrichedOffice365AuditLogs`, `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`. If managed identities are used for Azure resources, also send the `ManagedIdentitySignInLogs` log type. If the Entra ID Provisioning Service is used to provision users to software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps or other systems, also send the `ProvisioningLogs` log type.

Note: Agencies can benefit from security detection capabilities offered by the CISA Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW) system. Agencies are urged to send the logs to CLAW. Contact CISA at cyberliason@cisa.dhs.gov to request integration instructions.

#### Remediation action:

Follow the configuration instructions unique to the products and integration patterns at your organization to send the security logs to the security operations center for monitoring.

**Rationale:** The Global Administrator role provides unfettered access to the tenant (Azure and Microsoft 365). Limiting the number of users with this level of access makes tenant compromise more challenging. Microsoft recommends fewer than five users in the Global Administrator role. However, additional user accounts, up to eight, may be necessary to support emergency access and some operational scenarios.

#### Remediation action:

When counting the number of users assigned to the Global Administrator role, **count each user only once**.

1. In **Entra** under **Roles & adminis** and **[All roles](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/RolesManagementMenuBlade/~/AllRoles)**, search for **Global Administrator** and click on it to go to the role and see who is assiged. Count users that are assigned directly to the role and users assigned via group membership.

    If you have **Entra ID PIM**, count both the **Eligible assignments** and **Active assignments**.

    If any of the groups assigned to Global Administrator are enrolled in **PIM for Groups**, also count the number of group members from the PIM for Groups portal **Eligible** assignments.

2. Validate that there are a total of two to eight users assigned to the Global Administrator role.

Rationale: Many privileged administrative users do not need unfettered access to the tenant to perform their duties. By assigning them to roles based on least privilege, the risks associated with having their accounts compromised are reduced.

#### Remediation action:

This policy is based on the ratio below:

`X = (Number of users assigned to the Global Administrator role) / (Number of users assigned to other highly privileged roles)`

1. Follow the instructions for policy MS.AAD.7.1v1 above to get a count of users assigned to the Global Administrator role.
2. Follow the instructions for policy MS.AAD.7.1v1 above but get a count of users assigned to the other highly privileged roles (not Global Administrator). If a user is assigned to both Global Administrator and other roles, only count that user for the Global Administrator assignment.
3. Divide the value from step 2 from the value from step 1 to calculate X. If X is less than or equal to 1 then the tenant is compliant with the policy.

Rationale: Instead of giving users permanent assignments to privileged roles, provisioning access just in time lessens exposure if those accounts become compromised. In Azure AD PIM or an alternative PAM system, just in time access can be provisioned by assigning users to roles as eligible instead of perpetually active.

Note: Exceptions to this policy are:
* **Emergency access** accounts that need **perpetual access** to the tenant in the rare event of system degradation or other scenarios.
* Some types of **service accounts** that require a user account with privileged roles; since these accounts are used by software programs, they **cannot** perform role activation.

#### Remediation action:

    Perform the steps below for each highly privileged role. We reference the Global Administrator role as an example.

2. Select the **Global administrator** role.
3. Under **Manage**, select **Assignments** and click the **Active assignments** tab.
4. Verify there are no users or groups with a value of **Permanent** in the **End time** column. If there are any, recreate those assignments to have an expiration date using Entra ID PIM or an alternative PAM system. If a group is identified and it is enrolled in PIM for Groups, see the exception cases below for details.

Rationale: Provisioning users to privileged roles within a PAM system enables enforcement of numerous privileged access policies and monitoring. If privileged users are assigned directly to roles in the M365 admin center or via PowerShell outside of the context of a PAM system, a significant set of critical security capabilities are bypassed.

Rationale: Adversaries can use automatic forwarding to gain persistent access to a victim's email. Disabling forwarding to external domains prevents this technique when the adversary is external to the organization but does not impede legitimate internal forwarding.

#### Remediation action:

To disable automatic forwarding to external domains:

1. Sign in to the **Exchange admin center**.
2. Select **Mail flow**, then **[Remote domains](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/remotedomains)**.
3. Select **Default**.
4. Under **Email reply types**, select **Edit reply types**.
5. Clear the checkbox next to **Allow automatic forwarding**, then click **Save**.

Rationale: Malicious attachments often take the form of click-to-run files. Sharing high risk file types, when necessary, is better left to a means other than email; the dangers of allowing them to be sent over email outweigh any potential benefits. Filtering email attachments based on file types can prevent spread of malware distributed via click-to-run email attachments.

Rationale: Audit logs may no longer be available when needed if they are not retained for a sufficient time. Increased log retention time gives an agency the necessary visibility to investigate incidents that occurred some time ago. OMB M-21-13, Appendix C, Table 5 specifically calls out Unified Audit Logs in the Cloud Azure log category.

#### Remediation action:

To create one or more custom audit retention policies, if the default retention policy is not sufficient for agency needs, follow [Create an audit log retention policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=microsoft-purview-portal#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy) instructions.

Rationale: Failing to maintain an accurate list of authorized IP addresses may result in spoofed email messages or failure to deliver legitimate messages when SPF is enabled. Maintaining such a list helps ensure that unauthorized servers sending spoofed messages can be detected, and permits message delivery from legitimate senders.

#### Remediation action:

* Identify any approved senders specific to your agency.
* Perform regular review of SPF record and update as necessary.
* Additionally, see [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf) for inclusions required for Microsoft to send email on behalf of your domain.

Rationale: An adversary may modify the `FROM` field of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Publishing an SPF policy for each agency domain mitigates forged `FROM` fields by providing a means for recipients to detect emails spoofed in this way. SPF is required for FCEB departments and agencies by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01, ""Enhance Email and Web Security"".

Coexistence domains related to Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW) are skipped.
Production use of coexistence domains is discouraged, and additional controls, such as transport rules, should be used to restrict their use.

#### Remediation action:

SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed to set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online) for more details.

To test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as those listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain). Additionally, SPF records can be requested using the PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:

`Resolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt`

If SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all` returned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF policy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates the IP addresses listed by the policy for ""spf.protection.outlook.com"" are the only approved senders for ""example.onmicrosoft.com."" These IPs can be determined via an additional SPF lookup, this time for ""spf.protection.outlook.com."" Ensure the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domain are those identified for MS.EXO.2.1v1. [See SPF TXT record syntax for Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-anti-spoofing?view=o365-worldwide#spf-txt-record-syntax-for-microsoft-365) for a more in-depth discussion of SPF record syntax.

Rationale: An adversary may modify the `FROM` field of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Enabling DKIM is another means for recipients to detect spoofed emails and verify the integrity of email content.

Rationale: Without a DMARC policy available for each domain, recipients may improperly handle SPF and DKIM failures, possibly enabling spoofed emails to reach end users' mailboxes. Publishing DMARC records at the second-level domain protects the second-level domains and all subdomains.

#### Remediation action:

DMARC is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. As such, implementation varies depending on how an agency manages its DNS records. See [Form the DMARC TXT record for your domain | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dmarc-configure?view=o365-worldwide#step-4-form-the-dmarc-txt-record-for-your-domain) for Microsoft guidance.

A DMARC record published at the second-level domain will protect all subdomains. In other words, a DMARC record published for `example.com` will protect both `a.example.com` and `b.example.com`, but a separate record would need to be published for `c.example.gov`.

To test your DMARC configuration, consider using one of many publicly available web-based tools. Additionally, DMARC records can be requested using the PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:

`Resolve-DnsName _dmarc.example.com txt`

If DMARC is configured, a response resembling `v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov, mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:reports@example.com` will be returned, though by necessity, the contents of the record will vary by agency. In this example, the policy indicates all emails failing the SPF/DKIM checks are to be rejected and aggregate reports sent to reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov and reports@example.com. Failure reports will be sent to reports@example.com.

If an email fails DMARC validation, it often means that the sender is not who they claim to be, and the email could be fraudulent. The owner of the sending domain controls the DMARC policy for their domain, and provides recommendations to receivers on what action should be performed when DMARC fails. When the Honor DMARC Policy setting is set to False, the organisations policy is not considered. It is recommended to honor this policy.

Rationale:\
Allowing users to communicate with unmanaged Teams users presents a potential security threat as little effort is required by threat actors to gain access to a trial or free Microsoft Teams account.

8.2.3 (L1):\
This setting prevents external users who are not managed by an organization from initiating contact with users in the protected organization.
Note: Disabling this setting is used as an additional stop gap for the previous setting which disables communication with unmanaged Teams users entirely. If an organization chooses to have an exception to (L1) Ensure communication with unmanaged Teams users is disabled they can do so while also disabling the ability for the same group of users to initiate contact. Disabling communication entirely will also disable the ability for unmanaged users to initiate contact.

Rationale:\

This test checks if the usage of third-party and custom apps are disabled.

This policy setting controls which class of apps are available for users to install.

Rationale:\
Allowing users to install third-party or unverified apps poses a potential risk of  introducing malicious software to the environment.

#### Remediation action:

> **NOTE:** Previously, this could be managed from the Permission policies under Teams apps in the Teams admin portal. The Permission policies now redirects you to the Manage Apps page. You can manage apps there now using the `Org-wide app settings` under _Actions_, but it's easier to remediate the recommended settings using PowerShell.

This test checks if the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy is configured to only bypass the lobby for 'Peoply in my org'.

This policy setting controls who can join a meeting directly and who must wait in the lobby until they're admitted by an organizer, co-organizer, or presenter of the meeting.

Rationale:\
For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times.

#### Remediation action:

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.
3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**.
4. Seach for **Meeting join & lobby**.
5. Set **Who can bypass the lobby** to **People in my org**.
6. Click **Save**.

To change who can bypass the lobby using PowerShell:
1. Connect to Teams using **Connect-MicrosoftTeams**.
2. Run following PowerShell Command:

User reporting settings allow a user to report a message as malicious for further analysis. This recommendation is composed of 3 different settings and all be configured  to pass:
* In the Teams admin center: On by default and controls whether users are able to report messages from Teams. When this setting is turned off, users can't report messages within Teams, so the corresponding setting in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal is irrelevant.
* In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal: On by default for new tenants. Existing tenants need to enable it. If user reporting of messages is turned on in the Teams admin center, it also needs to be turned on the Defender portal for user reported messages to show up correctly on the User reported tab on the Submissions page.
* Defender - Report message destinations: This applies to more than just Microsoft Teams and allows for an organization to keep their reports contained. Due to how the parameters are configured on the backend it is included in this assessment as a requirement.

Rationale:\
Users will be able to more quickly and systematically alert administrators of suspicious malicious messages within Teams. The content of these messages may be sensitive in nature and therefore should be kept within the organization and not shared with Microsoft without first consulting company policy.

Note:\
- The reported message remains visible to the user in the Teams client.
- Users can report the same message multiple times.
- The message sender isn't notified that messages were reported.


#### Remediation action:

To change report security concerns settings using the UI:
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
2. Click to expand **Messaging** select **Messaging policies**.
3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**.
4. Set **Report a security concern** to **On**.

6. Click on **Settings** > **Email & collaboration** > **User reported settings**.
7. Scroll to **Microsoft Teams**.
8. Check **Monitor reported messages in Microsoft Teams** and **Save**.
9. Set **Send reported messages to:** to **My reporting mailbox only** with reports configured to be sent to authorized staff.

To change who can bypass the lobby using PowerShell:
1. Connect to Teams using **Connect-MicrosoftTeams**.
2. Connecto to ExchangeOnline using **Connect-ExchangeOnline**.
3. To configure the Teams reporting policy run the following PowerShell command:
```
Set-CsTeamsMessagingPolicy -Identity Global -AllowSecurityEndUserReporting $true
